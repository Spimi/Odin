What are the main differences between external, internal, and inline CSS?

- External: CSS created in a separate file, and a link element with rel attribute for relationship used in the HTML file for connecting together.
Example: <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">

- Internal: Involves adding CSS within the HTML file itself. 
Example: <style> div { color: white;} </style>

- Inline: It makes possible to add styles directly to HTML elements, it's not recommended.
Example: <div style="color: white; background-color: black;"> </div>

What is the syntax for class and ID selectors?
<div class="alert-text"> in HTML, .alert-text{} in CSS. 
<div id=title"> in HTML, #title {} in CSS.

How would you apply a single rule to two different selectors?
Group them together: .read, .unread {}

Given an element that has an id of title and a class of primary, how would you use both attributes for a single rule?
Chain them together: <p class="primary" id="title"> in HTML, .subsection#preview {} in CSS.

What does the descendant combinator do?
Combine multiple selectors by relationship. The descendant combinator will only cause elements that match the last selector to be selected. Ex:
<div class="ancestor">
   <div class="contents"> in HTML
.ancestor .contents{} in CSS.
This means all contents class nested inside ancestor class will be selected. 

Between a rule that uses one class selector and a rule that uses three type selectors, which rule has the higher specificity? 
The Class selector.

From inside to outside, what is the order of box-model properties?
Padding, border, margin.

What does the box-sizing CSS property do?
By default CSS count the elements height and width from the base + the padding + the border. With the box-sizing property changed to border box, we make the height and width to the actual box size.

What is the difference between the standard and alternative box model?
Standard: height and width defines the inline-size/block size of the content box.
Alternative: Any width of the width of the visible box on the page. The content are width are the width minus the width of the padding and the border.

Would you use margin or padding to create more space between 2 elements?
Margin. Margin collapses between two elements.

Would you use margin or padding to create more space between the contents of an element and its border?

What are the 3 values defined in the shorthand flex property (e.g. flex: 1 1 auto)?
flex-grow, flex-shrink, flex-basis

What are the 3 defined values for the flex shorthand flex:auto?
flex-grow: 1, flex-shrink: 1, flex-basis: auto
---------------------------------------------------------------

How do you make flex items arrange themselves vertically instead of horizontally?
flex-direction: column;

In a column flex-container, what does flex-basis refer to?
To the horizontal axis.

In a row flex-container, what does flex-basis refer to?
To the vertical axis.

Why do the previous two questions have different answers?
Because we change the main axis of the flex direction.

---------------------------------------------------------------

What is the difference between justify-content and align-items?
Justify-content is used for control the main axis, and align-items is used for control the cross axis.

How do you use flexbox to completely center a div inside a flex container?
align-items: center; justify-content: center;

What’s the difference between justify-content: space-between and justify-content: space-around?
space-between make equal amounts of space between the items.
space-around can change how the space is distributed around flex-items.
