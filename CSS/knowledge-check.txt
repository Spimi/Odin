What are the main differences between external, internal, and inline CSS?

- External: CSS created in a separate file, and a link element with rel attribute for relationship used in the HTML file for connecting together.
Example: <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">

- Internal: Involves adding CSS within the HTML file itself. 
Example: <style> div { color: white;} </style>

- Inline: It makes possible to add styles directly to HTML elements, it's not recommended.
Example: <div style="color: white; background-color: black;"> </div>

What is the syntax for class and ID selectors?
<div class="alert-text"> in HTML, .alert-text{} in CSS. 
<div id=title"> in HTML, #title {} in CSS.

How would you apply a single rule to two different selectors?
Group them together: .read, .unread {}

Given an element that has an id of title and a class of primary, how would you use both attributes for a single rule?
Chain them together: <p class="primary" id="title"> in HTML, .subsection#preview {} in CSS.

What does the descendant combinator do?
Combine multiple selectors by relationship. The descendant combinator will only cause elements that match the last selector to be selected. Ex:
<div class="ancestor">
   <div class="contents"> in HTML
.ancestor .contents{} in CSS.
This means all contents class nested inside ancestor class will be selected. 

Between a rule that uses one class selector and a rule that uses three type selectors, which rule has the higher specificity?
